Tarball (`tb`) is a handy script which allows the management of active and inactive projects.

Its based around the idea that you have two folders:
# An active folder full of extracted files (i.e. a folder containing more folders which in turn contain files)
# An archive folder which contains the Tarballs of the active folder

This script manages the backup from active -> archive and vise-versa.
